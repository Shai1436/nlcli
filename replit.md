# System Architecture

The application follows a modular, cross-platform architecture with clear separation of concerns, designed for performance, security, and extensibility.

## Core Components
- **Context Intelligence System**: Provides advanced Git repository awareness and environment variable integration for project-specific command suggestions (6+ project types, 15+ frameworks).
- **AI Translation Layer**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o with a 6-tier performance optimization system for command recognition:
    - Tier 1: Enhanced Typo Correction (<0.1ms)
    - Tier 2: Direct Command Filter (<1ms)
    - Tier 3: Enhanced Pattern Engine (<5ms)
    - Tier 4: Advanced Fuzzy Engine (<5ms)
    - Tier 5: Local Cache System (<10ms)
    - Tier 6: AI Translation (200-2000ms)
- **Command Filter System**: Directly executes 265+ known commands with sub-1ms response times, supporting platform-aware and cross-platform recognition (Windows↔Unix/Linux/macOS, PowerShell cmdlets, typo/variation coverage).
- **Interactive Command Selection**: Handles ambiguous natural language requests by presenting options, extracting parameters, and learning user preferences.
- **Enhanced Typo Correction System**: Sub-millisecond typo detection with 486+ command mappings and conversational command recognition.
- **Safety Validation**: Multi-level safety checking to prevent destructive operations, configurable by the user.
- **Command Execution Engine**: Manages cross-platform command execution, timeout, error handling, and secure subprocess execution.
