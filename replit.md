# Overview

Natural Language CLI Tool (nlcli) is a universal command-line interface that translates natural language into OS commands using OpenAI's GPT-4o. It aims to provide a cross-platform, intuitive way to execute system commands using plain English, integrating comprehensive safety measures, command history, and enterprise expansion capabilities.

# System Architecture

The application follows a modular, cross-platform architecture with clear separation of concerns, designed for performance, security, and extensibility.

## Core Components
- **AI Translation Layer**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini with a 6-tier performance optimization system (typo correction, direct command filter, instant pattern matching, fuzzy matching, local cache, AI translation) for speed and efficiency. It includes smart API key management and platform-specific prompting.
- **Command Filter System**: Directly executes 265+ known commands without AI translation, offering sub-1ms response times. It supports platform-aware and cross-platform command recognition, including bidirectional Windows↔Unix/Linux/macOS translation and PowerShell cmdlet support with comprehensive typo/variation coverage.
- **Interactive Command Selection**: Handles ambiguous natural language requests by presenting multiple command options, extracting parameters, and learning user preferences for seamless integration.
- **Enhanced Typo Correction System**: Provides sub-millisecond typo detection with 486+ total command mappings (265 Tier 1 + 221 Tier 2), comprehensive typo/variation coverage, and conversational command recognition.
- **Safety Validation**: Implements multi-level safety checking to prevent execution of destructive operations, configurable by the user.
- **Command Execution Engine**: Manages cross-platform command execution, timeout, error handling, and secure subprocess execution.
- **History Management**: Stores command history in an SQLite database, tracking natural language inputs, generated commands, and execution results with comprehensive CLI management.
- **Configuration System**: Manages settings via INI files, including AI parameters, performance optimizations, and user preferences.
- **Cache Management**: Utilizes an SQLite-based local cache for translation results, enhancing performance and tracking usage statistics.
- **CLI Interface**: Built with `Click` and `Rich`, providing an interactive mode with real-time performance indicators and subcommands.
- **Interactive Input System**: Offers Readline-based command history navigation, persistence, and search functionality.

## Data Storage
- **SQLite Database**: Local storage for command history and cache, indexed for efficient querying.
- **Configuration Files**: INI format files store user and system configurations in the home directory.

## Security Architecture
- **Multi-layered Safety System**: Employs pattern-based validation, dangerous command detection, and configurable user confirmation prompts.
- **API Key Management**: Securely handles OpenAI API keys via environment variables without logging sensitive information.

## Cross-Platform Design
- **Platform Abstraction**: Automatically detects OS and shell environment, applying platform-specific command patterns, safety rules, and shell preferences.

## Development Workflow
- **Test-Driven Development**: Employs a comprehensive unit test suite (180+ tests, 95%+ success rate) for robust error handling and edge case validation across all core components.
- **Quality Assurance**: Involves writing tests first, implementing features, running automated tests, validating performance, and updating documentation.
