# Overview

Natural Language CLI Tool (nlcli) is a universal command-line interface that translates natural language into OS commands using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The tool is designed as a cross-platform solution that works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing users with an intuitive way to execute system commands using plain English. The application includes comprehensive safety measures, command history tracking, and is built with enterprise expansion capabilities in mind.

## Development Workflow

**Test-Driven Development**
- Comprehensive unit test suite with 95+ instant pattern tests
- Automated test runner (`test_automation.py`) for continuous validation
- Tests run after each major change to ensure quality
- Pattern recognition tests validate 100% match rate for common commands
- Test categories: instant patterns, AI translation, safety checking, command execution

**Quality Assurance Process**
1. Write tests first for new features
2. Implement feature with pattern expansion
3. Run automated test suite (`python test_automation.py`)
4. Validate pattern match rates and performance
5. Update documentation and roadmap

# System Architecture

## Core Components

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**AI Translation Layer** (`ai_translator.py`)
- 4-tier performance optimization system for maximum speed:
  1. **Direct Command Filter** (sub-5ms): 70+ exact commands bypass AI completely
  2. **Instant Pattern Matching** (sub-millisecond): 60+ common commands recognized immediately
  3. **Local SQLite Cache** (sub-millisecond): Stores and retrieves previous translations
  4. **AI Translation** (2-3 seconds): GPT-4o-mini with timeout and concurrent execution
- Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini API for faster responses
- Uses platform-specific prompts to generate appropriate OS commands
