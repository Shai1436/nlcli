# Overview

Natural Language CLI Tool (nlcli) is a universal command-line interface that translates natural language into OS commands using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The tool is designed as a cross-platform solution that works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing users with an intuitive way to execute system commands using plain English. The application includes comprehensive safety measures, command history tracking, and is built with enterprise expansion capabilities in mind.
