- Interactive pipeline visualization working

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Click "Deploy" button** in workspace header
2. **Select "Autoscale"** deployment type
3. **Configure settings:**
   - **Machine Size**: Basic (sufficient for the demo)
   - **Run Command**: `python app.py` (Flask web demo)
   - **Environment**: Production
4. **Click "Deploy"**

### Option 2: Reserved VM Deployment

For guaranteed resources:
1. **Click "Deploy" button**
2. **Select "Reserved VM"**
3. **Configure:**
   - **Machine Size**: Basic or Boosted
   - **Run Command**: `python app.py`
4. **Deploy**
