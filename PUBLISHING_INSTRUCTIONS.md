# PyPI Publishing Instructions - nlcli v1.2.0

## Issue Diagnosed ✅

The publishing failed due to **network connectivity restrictions** in the Replit environment. This is normal - Replit workspaces have limited outbound network access for security.

**Error**: `Failed to resolve 'metadata'` when trying to connect to PyPI servers.

## Solution: Publish from Local Environment

### Step 1: Download the Built Package
Download these files from the Replit workspace to your local machine:
- `dist/nlcli-1.2.0.tar.gz`
- `dist/nlcli-1.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`

### Step 2: Local Publishing Setup
On your local machine:

```bash
# Install twine if not already installed
pip install twine

# Verify the downloaded packages
twine check nlcli-1.2.0*

# Upload to PyPI (you'll be prompted for credentials)
twine upload nlcli-1.2.0*
```

### Step 3: Alternative - GitHub Actions (Recommended)
Set up automated publishing via GitHub Actions:

1. **Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`**:
```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
      run: twine upload dist/*
```

2. **Set up PyPI API Token**:
   - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Create a new API token
   - Add it to GitHub Secrets as `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Tag version: `v1.2.0`
   - Title: `v1.2.0: Enhanced Partial Matching Pipeline`
   - Description: Use content from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.0.md`

## Package Status ✅

**Package Built Successfully**:
- ✅ `nlcli-1.2.0.tar.gz` (133 KB) - source distribution
- ✅ `nlcli-1.2.0-py3-none-any.whl` (138 KB) - wheel distribution
- ✅ Both packages passed integrity checks (`twine check`)
- ✅ Package imports correctly (`nlcli.__version__ == '1.2.0'`)

**Ready for Publishing**:
- All v1.2.0 features included
- Enhanced Partial Matching Pipeline implemented
- Documentation updated
- Demo website deployed

## Verification After Publishing

Once published to PyPI, verify with:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install nlcli==1.2.0

# Test the enhanced features
nlcli
> netwok status    # Should process in <100ms via Semantic Hub
> shw files        # Fast typo correction
> docker ps        # Instant recognition
```

## Alternative: Test PyPI First

For testing before production:

```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi nlcli-1.2.0*

# Test installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nlcli==1.2.0
```

---

**Summary**: The package is ready and properly built. The failure was due to Replit's network restrictions, not package issues. Use local publishing or GitHub Actions for deployment.
