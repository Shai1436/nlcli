### Test Fixes Applied

1. **Safety Checker Tests**:
   - Fixed API method calls (`is_safe` → `check_command`)
   - Added comprehensive safety level testing
   - Enhanced edge case coverage
   - Added platform-specific pattern validation

2. **Command Executor Tests**:
   - Fixed parameter type mismatches (float → int timeouts)
   - Corrected working directory parameter (`working_dir` → `cwd`)
   - Removed unsupported API parameters
   - Added comprehensive error handling tests

3. **Cache Manager Tests**:
   - Fixed statistics key access with safe getters
   - Enhanced hit rate calculation tests
   - Added edge case handling
