# Final Publishing Instructions - nlcli v1.2.0

## âœ… Package Ready for PyPI

Your nlcli v1.2.0 package has been successfully built and validated. Here's how to complete the publishing process:

## Option 1: Automatic Publishing (Recommended)

Run the automated publishing script I created:

```bash
python publish_to_pypi.py
```

This script will:
1. Check the package integrity
2. Upload to PyPI (you'll be prompted for credentials)
3. Provide next steps

## Option 2: Manual Publishing

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Check package (already done âœ…)
twine check dist/nlcli-1.2.0*

# 2. Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/nlcli-1.2.0*
```

When prompted, enter your PyPI credentials:
- Username: your PyPI username
- Password: your PyPI password or API token

## What You'll Need

### PyPI Account Setup
1. **Create PyPI account** at https://pypi.org/account/register/ if you don't have one
2. **Optional**: Set up API token for secure authentication
3. **Project permissions**: Ensure you have upload rights to `nlcli` package

### After Publishing

1. **Verify the upload**:
   ```bash
   pip install nlcli==1.2.0
   nlcli --version  # Should show v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Test the enhanced features**:
   ```bash
   nlcli
   > netwok status    # Should process in <100ms via Semantic Hub
   > shw files        # Fast typo correction
   ```

3. **Create GitHub release**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```
