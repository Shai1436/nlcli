| Module | Coverage | Status | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Fuzzy Engine | 86% | ✅ Excellent | Advanced pattern matching well tested |
| Output Formatter | 78% | ✅ Good | Rich terminal output coverage |
| Command Filter | 73% | ✅ Good | Core command recognition tested |
| File Cache | 72% | ✅ Good | Caching system well covered |
| Pattern Engine | 69% | ⚠️ Moderate | Semantic patterns partially tested |
| Config Manager | 53% | ⚠️ Moderate | Configuration handling needs work |
| History Manager | 52% | ⚠️ Moderate | Command history partially covered |
| AI Translator | 48% | ⚠️ Moderate | Core translation logic needs testing |
| Utils | 41% | ❌ Low | Utility functions under-tested |
| Cache Manager | 38% | ❌ Low | Cache management needs attention |
| Command Executor | 34% | ❌ Low | Command execution under-tested |
| Safety Checker | 28% | ❌ Low | Critical security module needs work |

## Test Execution Summary

- **Total Tests**: 220 tests collected
- **Passing Tests**: ~185 (84% success rate)
- **Failed Tests**: ~35 (16% failure rate)
- **Critical Modules Working**: Core translation and command filtering functional

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Test Interface Mismatches
- CommandExecutor API changed (missing parameters in tests)
- SafetyChecker missing `is_safe` method in tests
- Cache statistics keys missing (`total_hits`)

### 2. Module Coverage Gaps
- **Safety Checker (28%)**: Critical security module under-tested
- **Command Executor (34%)**: Core execution engine needs more tests
- **Cache Manager (38%)**: Performance optimization under-tested

### 3. Test Failures by Category
- **API Interface**: 15+ failures due to method signature changes
- **Missing Methods**: 11+ failures for undefined methods
- **Configuration**: 4+ failures in config handling
- **Pattern Matching**: 7+ failures in advanced pattern recognition

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (High Risk)
1. **Fix Safety Checker tests** - Critical security module
2. **Update CommandExecutor test interfaces** - Core functionality
3. **Repair Cache Manager statistics** - Performance metrics

### Medium Priority (Quality)
1. **Increase Command Executor coverage** to 60%+
2. **Improve AI Translator tests** for edge cases
3. **Enhance Utils module testing** for reliability

### Low Priority (Future)
1. **Pattern Engine refinement** for complex scenarios
2. **Config Manager edge cases** for robustness
3. **Integration test coverage** for end-to-end workflows

## Current Status Assessment

✅ **Strengths**:
- Core command filtering and translation working
- Advanced pattern matching well tested
- File caching system robust
- Output formatting comprehensive

⚠️ **Concerns**:
- Security module under-tested
- Command execution coverage low
- Test interface mismatches indicating API drift

❌ **Critical Gaps**:
- Safety validation insufficient testing
- Configuration edge cases missing
- Cache performance metrics broken

## Overall Grade: B- (Good functionality, needs test quality improvement)

The codebase has strong core functionality with good coverage in key areas like pattern matching and output formatting. However, critical security and execution modules need more comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and safety.
